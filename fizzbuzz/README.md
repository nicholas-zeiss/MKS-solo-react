## ngFizzBuzz
* Play fizzbuzz with angular
  * [ ] Implement a counter as a service or factory
  * [ ] Increment your counter every time it is clicked
  * [ ] If the counter is divisible by three, display FIZZ
  * [ ] If the counter is divisible by five, display BUZZ
  * [ ] If the counter is divisible by both, display FIZZBUZZ
* [ ] Optionally, implement your view as a directive (but keep your logic in the controller)
* [ ] Optionally, implement your service/factory as a factory/service, and as a provider

* You'll need to serve fizzbuzz as a web page (not from a file). Now's a great time to `brew install python` and `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
